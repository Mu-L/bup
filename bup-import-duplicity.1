.SH NAME
.PP
bup-import-duplicity - import duplicity backups
.SH WARNING
.PP
bup-import-duplicity is \f[B]EXPERIMENTAL\f[R] (proceed with caution)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup import-duplicity [-n] <source-url> <save-name>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup import-duplicity\f[R] imports all of the duplicity backups at
\f[C]source-url\f[R] into \f[C]bup\f[R] via
\f[C]bup save -n save-name\f[R].
The bup saves will have the same timestamps (via
\f[C]bup save --date\f[R]) as the original backups.
.PP
Because this command operates by restoring each duplicity backup to a
temporary directory, the extent to which the metadata is preserved will
depend on the characteristics of the underlying filesystem, whether or
not you run \f[C]import-duplicity\f[R] as root (or under
\f[C]fakeroot\f[R](1)), etc.
.PP
Note that this command will use
\f[C]mkdtemp\f[R] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkdtemp)
to create temporary directories, which means that it should respect any
\f[C]TEMPDIR\f[R], \f[C]TEMP\f[R], or \f[C]TMP\f[R] environment variable
settings.
Make sure that the relevant filesystem has enough space for the largest
duplicity backup being imported.
.PP
Since all invocations of duplicity use a temporary
\f[C]--archive-dir\f[R], \f[C]import-duplicity\f[R] should not affect
\[ti]/.cache/duplicity.
